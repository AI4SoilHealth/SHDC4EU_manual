This document provides information about the Soil Health Data Cube for pan-EU (SHDC4EU). The main purpose of the SHDC is to be as a platform for more detailed computing i.e. to estimate trends in important soil health indicators (e.g. Bare Soil Fraction, vegetation cover, chemical soil properties and similar). The SHDC is available via S3 (Simple Storage Service) and STAC as open data, which means that any researcher across EU can access data directly using [rstac](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rstac) or similar, and fetch values / aggregate per polygon or farm. list will be continuously updated and extended.

Soil Health Data Cube for pan-EU (SHDC4EU) is compilation of pan-EU layers organized into a data cube and served through an API as analysis or decision ready data. It will be published via the EcoDataCube.eu infrastructure and served with unrestricted access as a genuine open data project comparable to Copernicus Land Monitoring  services, Zenodo.org, Amazon AWS Open Data and similar. It aims at serving the [EU Soil Observatory](https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/eu-soil-observatory-euso_en) hosted by the European Commission JRC. We are preparing a complete, consistent Data Cube which will include EU-wide seasonal crop-type maps, primary soil properties, land degradation indices, terrain parameters, and similar EO products, all at 30-m resolution and encompassing the period 2000â€“2024+, climatic time-series images (rainfall, soil moisture, surface temperature) and projected crop models (typically only at 1-km spatial resolution). These will then be combined into a unified complete consistent data cube that can be used to run machine learning models to detect and examine relationships between the field-estimated and EO-based SHI. The general workflow of using the SHDC4EU, in a nutshell, is: (1) assess the management and eventual degradation history of a piece of land, (2) assess current properties and states, and (3) assess potential of soil + land under different (climate change) scenarios. This is the basic framework which other WPs can use as a computing engine on top of which to build their particular applications. For processing: (1) data is used to assess the history of each pixel in terms of positive and negative trends in GPP, vegetation cover, SOC and other soil properties, (2) the most recent (actual) soil properties and classes will be provided to individual pixels / farms, and (3) the land potential will be estimated by extrapolating process-based and/or ML models to future climate land-use scenarios.

## Download compiled data {.unnumbered}

Compiled data (imported, standardized, quality-controlled) is available 
through a diversity of standard formats:

- COG files (compressed Cloud Optimized GeoTIFFs);
- GPKG files ([Geopackage file](https://www.geopackage.org/) ready to be opened in QGIS);

All files can be downloaded using the STAC browser.

## Add your own data {.unnumbered}

The minimum requirements to submit a dataset for inclusion to Soil Health Data Cube are:

-   **Pan-EU coverage** (or at least aiming at the global coverage) AND,\
-   License and terms of use clearly specified AND,\
-   Complete and consistent metadata that can ensure correct
    standardization and harmonization steps AND,\
-   At least 50 unique spatial locations AND,\
-   No broken or invalid URLs,

Data sets that do NOT satisfy the above listed minimum requirements might be
removed. If you discover an issue with license, data description or
version number of a dataset, please open a [Github
issue](https://github.com/AI4SoilHealth/SHDC4EU_manual/issues).

Recommended settings for all datasets are:

-   Peer-reviewed versions of the datasets (i.e. a dataset accompanied
    with a peer-reviewed publication) should have the priority,\
-   Register your dataset (use e.g. <https://zenodo.org/communities/ai4soilhealth/>) and assign a DOI
    to each version,\
-   Provide enough metadata so that it can be imported and bind with
    other data without errors,\
-   If your dataset is a compilation of previously published datasets, please 
    indicate in the description,

Information outdated or missing? Please open an issue or best do a
correction and then a [pull
request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

## About OpenGeoHub {.unnumbered}

[<img src="./images/opengeohub_logo_ml.png" alt="OpenGeoHub logo" width="350"/>](https://opengeohub.org)

**OpenGeoHub foundation** is a not-for-profit research foundation
located in Wageningen, the Netherlands. We specifically promote
publishing and sharing of Open Geographical and Geoscientific Data,
using and developing Open Source Software and encouraging and empowering
under-represented researchers e.g. those from ODA recipient countries
and female researchers. We believe that the key measure of quality of
research in all sciences (and especially in geographical information
sciences) is in transparency and reproducibility of the computer code
used to generate results (read more in: ["Everyone has a right to know what is happening with the planet"](https://opengeohub.medium.com/)).
