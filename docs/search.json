    "text": "This document provides information about the Soil Health Data Cube for pan-EU (SHDC4EU). The main purpose of the SHDC is to be as a platform for more detailed computing i.e. to estimate trends in important soil health indicators (e.g. Bare Soil Fraction, vegetation cover, chemical soil properties and similar). The SHDC is available via S3 (Simple Storage Service) and STAC as open data, which means that any researcher across EU can access data directly using rstac or similar, and fetch values / aggregate per polygon or farm. list will be continuously updated and extended. This document is continuously updated and new layers are continuously added.\n\nSoil Health Data Cube for pan-EU (SHDC4EU) is compilation of pan-EU layers organized into a data cube and served through an API as analysis or decision ready data. It will be published via the EcoDataCube.eu infrastructure and served with unrestricted access as a genuine open data project comparable to Copernicus Land Monitoring services, Zenodo.org, Amazon AWS Open Data and similar. It aims at serving the EU Soil Observatory hosted by the European Commission JRC. We are preparing a complete, consistent Data Cube which will include EU-wide seasonal crop-type maps, primary soil properties, land degradation indices, terrain parameters, and similar EO products, all at 30-m resolution and encompassing the period 2000–2024+, climatic time-series images (rainfall, soil moisture, surface temperature) and projected crop models (typically only at 1-km spatial resolution). These will then be combined into a unified complete consistent data cube that can be used to run machine learning models to detect and examine relationships between the field-estimated and EO-based SHI. The general workflow of using the SHDC4EU, in a nutshell, is: (1) assess the management and eventual degradation history of a piece of land, (2) assess current properties and states, and (3) assess potential of soil + land under different (climate change) scenarios. This is the basic framework which other WPs can use as a computing engine on top of which to build their particular applications. For processing: (1) data is used to assess the history of each pixel in terms of positive and negative trends in GPP, vegetation cover, SOC and other soil properties, (2) the most recent (actual) soil properties and classes will be provided to individual pixels / farms, and (3) the land potential will be estimated by extrapolating process-based and/or ML models to future climate land-use scenarios.\n\n\nCompiled data (imported, standardized, quality-controlled) is available through a diversity of standard formats:\n\nGridded data as COG files (compressed Cloud Optimized GeoTIFFs);\nVector data as GPKG files (Geopackage file ready to be opened in QGIS);\nTabular data is available either as CSV files or as Google Sheets;\n\nAll files can be downloaded using the STAC browser and/or using embedded links provided in this document.\n\n\n\nAI4SoilHealth project aims at buidling open development communities where data and code is exchange seamlessly under the Open Data / Open Source licenses (e.g. CC-BY, CC-BY-SA, ODbL, MIT, GPL and simlar). We are open to hosting contributed geospatial data produced by 3rd parties assuming that some minimum requirements are met. Currently, the minimum requirements to submit a dataset for inclusion to Soil Health Data Cube are:\n\nPan-EU coverage (or at least aiming at the global coverage) AND,\n\nLicense and terms of use clearly specified AND,\n\nComplete and consistent metadata that can ensure correct standardization and harmonization steps AND,\n\nPredictions of soil properties are Complete Consistent Current and Correct and based on the most significant data AND,\n\nNo broken or invalid URLs,\n\nData sets that do NOT satisfy the above listed minimum requirements might be removed. If you discover an issue with license, data description or version number of a dataset, please open a Github issue.\nRecommended settings for all datasets are:\n\nPeer-reviewed versions of the datasets (i.e. a dataset accompanied with a peer-reviewed publication) should have the priority,\n\nRegister your dataset (use e.g. https://zenodo.org/communities/ai4soilhealth/) and assign a DOI to each version,\n\nProvide enough metadata so that it can be imported and bind with other data without errors,\n\nIf your dataset is a compilation of previously published datasets, please indicate in the description,\n\nInformation outdated or missing? Please open an issue or best do a correction and then a pull request.\n\n\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.\n\n\n\nUse liability: OpenGeoHub foundations cannot provide any warranty as to the accuracy, reliability, or completeness of furnished data.
