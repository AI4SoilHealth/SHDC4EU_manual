The main purpose of the SHDC is to be as a platform for more detailed computing i.e. to estimate trends in important soil health indicators (e.g. Bare Soil Fraction, vegetation cover, chemical soil properties and similar). The SHDC is available via S3 (Simple Storage Service) and STAC as open data, which means that any researcher across EU can access data directly using [rstac](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rstac) or similar, and fetch values / aggregate per polygon or farm. list will be continuously updated and extended. **This document is continuously updated and new layers are continuously added**.\n\n<a href=\"https://a4soilhealth.eu/\"><img src=\"./images/cover.png\" alt=\"AI4SoilHealth logo\" width=\"300\"></a>\n\nSoil Health Data Cube for pan-EU (SHDC4EU) is compilation of pan-EU layers \norganized into a data cube and served through an API as analysis or decision \nready data. It will be published via the EcoDataCube.eu infrastructure and served \nwith unrestricted access as a genuine open data project comparable to Copernicus \nLand Monitoring  services, Zenodo.org, Amazon AWS Open Data and similar. It aims \nat serving the [EU Soil Observatory](https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/eu-soil-observatory-euso_en) \nhosted by the European Commission JRC. We are preparing a complete, consistent \nData Cube which will include EU-wide seasonal crop-type maps, primary soil properties, \nland degradation indices, terrain parameters, and similar EO products, all at 30-m \nresolution and encompassing the period 2000–2024+, climatic time-series images \n(rainfall, soil moisture, surface temperature) and projected crop models (typically \nonly at 1-km spatial resolution). These will then be combined into a unified \ncomplete consistent data cube that can be used to run machine learning models to \ndetect and examine relationships between the field-estimated and EO-based SHI. \nThe general workflow of using the SHDC4EU, in a nutshell, is: (1) assess the \nmanagement and eventual degradation history of a piece of land, (2) assess current \nproperties and states, and (3) assess potential of soil + land under different \n(climate change) scenarios. This is the basic framework which other WPs can use \nas a computing engine on top of which to build their particular applications. \nFor processing: (1) data is used to assess the history of each pixel in terms of \npositive and negative trends in GPP, vegetation cover, SOC and other soil properties, \n(2) the most recent (actual) soil properties and classes will be provided to \nindividual pixels / farms, and (3) the land potential will be estimated by \nextrapolating process-based and/or ML models to future climate land-use scenarios.\n\n## Download compiled data {.unnumbered}\n\nCompiled data (imported, standardized, quality-controlled) is available \nthrough a diversity of standard formats:\n\n- Gridded data as COG files (compressed Cloud Optimized GeoTIFFs);\n- Vector data as GPKG files ([Geopackage file](https://www.geopackage.org/) ready to be opened in QGIS);\n- Tabular data is available either as CSV files or as Google Sheets;\n\nAll files can be downloaded using the STAC browser and/or using embedded links \nprovided in this document.\n\n## Add your own data {.unnumbered}\n\nAI4SoilHealth project aims at buidling open development communities where data and \ncode is exchange seamlessly under the Open Data / Open Source licenses (e.g. CC-BY, CC-BY-SA, ODbL, MIT, GPL and simlar).\nWe are open to hosting contributed geospatial data produced by 3rd parties assuming \nthat some minimum requirements are met. Currently, the minimum requirements to submit \na dataset for inclusion to Soil Health Data Cube are:\n  \n-   **Pan-EU coverage** (or at least aiming at the global coverage) AND,\\\n-   License and terms of use clearly specified AND,\\\n-   Complete and consistent metadata that can ensure correct\nstandardization and harmonization steps AND,\\\n-   Predictions of soil properties are Complete Consistent Current and Correct and based on the most significant data AND,\\\n-   No broken or invalid URLs,\n\nData sets that do NOT satisfy the above listed minimum requirements might be\nremoved. If you discover an issue with license, data description or\nversion number of a dataset, please open a [Github issue](https://github.com/AI4SoilHealth/SHDC4EU_manual/issues).\n\nRecommended settings for all datasets are:\n\n-   Peer-reviewed versions of the datasets (i.e. a dataset accompanied with a peer-reviewed publication) should have the priority,\\\n-   Register your dataset (use e.g. <https://zenodo.org/communities/ai4soilhealth/>) and assign a DOI\nto each version,\\\n-   Provide enough metadata so that it can be imported and bind with\nother data without errors,\\\n-   If your dataset is a compilation of previously published datasets, please \nindicate in the description,\n\nInformation outdated or missing? Please open an issue or best do a\ncorrection and then a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).\n\n## License {.unnumbered}\n\n<a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\"><img alt=\"Creative Commons License\" style=\"border-width:0\" src=\"https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-sa/4.0/88x31.png\" /></a><br />This work is licensed under a <a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International License</a>.\n\n## Disclaimer {.unnumbered}\n\nUse liability: OpenGeoHub foundations cannot provide any warranty as to the accuracy, \nreliability, or completeness of furnished data.
