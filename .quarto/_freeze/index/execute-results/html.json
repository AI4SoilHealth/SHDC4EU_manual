The main purpose of the SHDC is to be as a platform for more detailed computing i.e. to estimate trends in important soil health indicators (e.g. Bare Soil Fraction, vegetation cover, chemical soil properties and similar). The SHDC is available via S3 (Simple Storage Service) and STAC as open data, which means that any researcher across EU can access data directly using [rstac](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rstac) or similar, and fetch values / aggregate per polygon or farm. list will be continuously updated and extended. \n\n<a href=\"https://a4soilhealth.eu/\"><img src=\"./images/cover.png\" alt=\"AI4SoilHealth logo\" width=\"300\"></a>\n\nSoil Health Data Cube for pan-EU (SHDC4EU) is compilation of pan-EU layers organized into a data cube and served through an API as analysis or decision ready data. It will be published via the EcoDataCube.eu infrastructure and served with unrestricted access as a genuine open data project comparable to Copernicus Land Monitoring  services, Zenodo.org, Amazon AWS Open Data and similar. It aims at serving the [EU Soil Observatory](https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/eu-soil-observatory-euso_en) hosted by the European Commission JRC. We are preparing a complete, consistent Data Cube which will include EU-wide seasonal crop-type maps, primary soil properties, land degradation indices, terrain parameters, and similar EO products, all at 30-m resolution and encompassing the period 2000â€“2024+, climatic time-series images (rainfall, soil moisture, surface temperature) and projected crop models (typically only at 1-km spatial resolution). These will then be combined into a unified complete consistent data cube that can be used to run machine learning models to detect and examine relationships between the field-estimated and EO-based SHI. The general workflow of using the SHDC4EU, in a nutshell, is: (1) assess the management and eventual degradation history of a piece of land, (2) assess current properties and states, and (3) assess potential of soil + land under different (climate change) scenarios. This is the basic framework which other WPs can use as a computing engine on top of which to build their particular applications. For processing: (1) data is used to assess the history of each pixel in terms of positive and negative trends in GPP, vegetation cover, SOC and other soil properties, (2) the most recent (actual) soil properties and classes will be provided to individual pixels / farms, and (3) the land potential will be estimated by extrapolating process-based and/or ML models to future climate land-use scenarios.\n\n## Download compiled data {.unnumbered}\n\nCompiled data (imported, standardized, quality-controlled) is available \nthrough a diversity of standard formats:\n\n- COG files (compressed Cloud Optimized GeoTIFFs);\n- GPKG files ([Geopackage file](https://www.geopackage.org/) ready to be opened in QGIS);\n\nAll files can be downloaded using the STAC browser.\n\n## Add your own data {.unnumbered}\n\nThe minimum requirements to submit a dataset for inclusion to Soil Health Data Cube are:\n\n-   **Pan-EU coverage** (or at least aiming at the global coverage) AND,\\\n-   License and terms of use clearly specified AND,\\\n-   Complete and consistent metadata that can ensure correct\n    standardization and harmonization steps AND,\\\n-   At least 50 unique spatial locations AND,\\\n-   No broken or invalid URLs,\n\nData sets that do NOT satisfy the above listed minimum requirements might be\nremoved. If you discover an issue with license, data description or\nversion number of a dataset, please open a [Github\nissue](https://github.com/AI4SoilHealth/SHDC4EU_manual/issues).\n\nRecommended settings for all datasets are:\n\n-   Peer-reviewed versions of the datasets (i.e. a dataset accompanied\n    with a peer-reviewed publication) should have the priority,\\\n-   Register your dataset (use e.g. <https://zenodo.org/communities/ai4soilhealth/>) and assign a DOI\n    to each version,\\\n-   Provide enough metadata so that it can be imported and bind with\n    other data without errors,\\\n-   If your dataset is a compilation of previously published datasets, please \n    indicate in the description,\n\nInformation outdated or missing? Please open an issue or best do a\ncorrection and then a [pull\nrequest](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).\n\n## License {.unnumbered}\n\n<a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\"><img alt=\"Creative Commons License\" style=\"border-width:0\" src=\"https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-sa/4.0/88x31.png\" /></a><br />This work is licensed under a <a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International License</a>.\n\n## Disclaimer {.unnumbered}\n\nUse liability: OpenGeoHub foundations cannot provide any warranty as to the accuracy, \nreliability, or completeness of furnished data.

We specifically promote\npublishing and sharing of Open Geographical and Geoscientific Data,\nusing and developing Open Source Software and encouraging and empowering\nunder-represented researchers e.g. those from ODA recipient countries\nand female researchers. We believe that the key measure of quality of\nresearch in all sciences (and especially in geographical information\nsciences) is in transparency and reproducibility of the computer code\nused to generate results (read more in: [\"Everyone has a right to know what is happening with the planet\"](https://opengeohub.medium.com/)).\n\n\n## Acknowledgments {.unnumbered}\n\n**[AI4SoilHealth.eu](https://AI4SoilHealth.eu)** project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon Europe research an innovation programme under grant agreement **[No. 101086179](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101086179)**.\n",
